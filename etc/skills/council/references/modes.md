# Council modes (selection, escalation, early stopping)

Three modes trade off thoroughness against cost and latency. The right mode depends on stakes, reversibility, and available time.

## Mode definitions

### Quick

- **Advisors:** 3 (Red Team, Executor, First Principles)
- **Peer review:** none
- **Debate round:** no
- **Bias audit:** skipped (saves one call; speed is the point of Quick)
- **Chairman:** single (Consensus only, no Dissent pass)
- **Dissent Ledger:** no
- **~Calls:** 4 (3 advisors + 1 chairman)
- **~Wall-clock:** 25-40 seconds

**When Quick is appropriate:**
- User explicitly says "quick" or "fast"
- Time-pressured framing in the question ("I need to decide in an hour", "meeting in 30 mins")
- Stakes are clearly bounded: reversible within 1 day, or below ~$1k in consequence
- The question is genuinely constrained: not much to debate

**Quick verdict structure:** same 5 H2 sections but from a single chairman. No confidence header, no Dissent Ledger. Tell the user at the end: "This was a Quick council. Run `/council [same question] deep` if you want full analysis."

### Standard

- **Advisors:** 5 (all)
- **Peer review:** 5 parallel calls
- **Debate round:** conditional (triggers if consensus-strength average ≥ 4.0)
- **Chairman:** dual (Consensus + Dissent in parallel) + Dissent Preservation Pass
- **Dissent Ledger:** yes
- **~Calls:** 14 without debate, 16 with debate
- **~Wall-clock:** 75-110 seconds

Standard is the default for most real decisions. Use it when you don't know which mode fits: the escalation logic below will auto-escalate if needed.

### Deep

- **Advisors:** 5 (all, with expanded Tree-of-Thoughts: all 3 reframings returned for First Principles, all 3 options returned for Expansionist)
- **Peer review:** 5 parallel calls
- **Debate round:** always runs
- **Chairman:** dual + Dissent Preservation Pass
- **Dissent Ledger:** yes
- **~Calls:** 16
- **~Wall-clock:** 130-180 seconds

**When Deep is appropriate:**
- User explicitly says "deep"
- High-stakes markers: irreversible decisions, large financial/organizational consequences, team-affecting calls
- Standard returned low confidence (see escalation below)
- User opted in after being offered escalation

## Mode selection logic

The orchestrator picks mode in this order:

1. **Explicit suffix wins:** "quick" → Quick, "deep" → Deep
2. **Stake markers in the framed question:** look for: "can't undo", "irreversible", "bet the company", "my career", "we only get one shot", "six figures", "everyone is watching" → auto-select Deep
3. **Default:** Standard

## Escalation after Standard

After the dual-chairman step, compute:
- `advisor_confidence_low_count`: number of advisors who output `confidence: low`
- `chairman_confidence`: the level in the verdict header

Escalation triggers if: `chairman_confidence` is `low`, OR `advisor_confidence_low_count ≥ 3`, OR the Clashes section has ≥ 2 genuinely unresolved items (no "more persuasive" conclusion reached).

When escalation triggers: use AskUserQuestion "Council confidence is low. Escalate to Deep mode for a more thorough analysis?" If yes, re-run from the fan-out step in Deep mode, passing prior results as context so advisors can refine rather than restart.

If the user declines escalation, proceed with the Standard verdict and state the low confidence prominently.

## Early stopping

- **Standard**: if peer-review consensus-strength average is ≤ 2.0, skip the debate round because there is no consensus to attack.
- **Standard**: if all 5 advisor confidence blocks are `high`, the Dissent Preservation Pass may return "Clean". Don't manufacture disagreement.
